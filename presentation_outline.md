## Graphs
- smooth out graphs to compare avg values/trends with each other
- smaller time frame to study variation in y values



## Story
- expectations? <> constant
- one way <> other way
- (could not get to pi data in time)

### Why should you care?
- game
- response time
- let's just say response time is important if one decides to block your siblings' internet via a firewall

### What did I do?
- map
- ping two ways
- procedure
  - ping (timeout after 2 s -> loss)
  - wait 2s
  - repeat

### What are the results?
- 27mb of data
- suspicious down spikes (caused by ping?)

- one day
- no avg
- avg
